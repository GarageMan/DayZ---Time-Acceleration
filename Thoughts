TimeDaylight (in hrs): The duration of the daylight time on your DayZ server
TimeNight (in hrs): The duration of the night on your DayZ server

Each value must be higher than 0
The sum of the values must be higher than 0 and lower than 24.

TimeDay = TimeDaylight + TimeNight (that is the total time of a day on your DayZ server)

serverTimeAcceleration = 24 / TimeDay
serverNightTimeAcceleration = TimeDaylight / TimeNight

I did not test values below 1 (but higher than 0) for the serverNightTimeAcceleration. 
That should lead to a longer night time than daylight time, which is usual in the winter time period!
